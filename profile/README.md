The members of this organization are maintainers of those libraries, they have admin powers, and can merge pull requests.

**To become a member** you must:

1. Abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ssbc/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2. Have 2-factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account
3. Have had created enough pull requests to our repos and gotten them merged by others members
4. Have been active at least once during the last 12 months

###### The last 2 rules are calculated automatically via [TrustNet Org](https://github.com/staltz/trustnet-org) every Monday as a [GitHub Actions job](https://github.com/ssbc/.github/actions/workflows/members.yml). These 4 rules are temporary, and should be completely re-evaluated on April 12th 2023.
